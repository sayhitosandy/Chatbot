did
you
change
your
hair

no

you
might
wan
na
think
about

i
missed
you

it
says
here
you
exposed
yourself
to
a
group
of
freshmen
girls

it
was
a
bratwurst
.
i
was
eating
lunch

with
the
teeth
of
your
zipper

you
the
new
guy

so
they
tell
me

c
mon
.
i
m
supposed
to
give
you
the
tour

so
which
dakota
you
from

north
actually
.
how
d
you

i
was
kidding
.
people
actually
live
there

yeah
.
a
couple
.
we
re
outnumbered
by
the
cows
though

how
many
people
were
in
your
old
school

thirty
two

get
out

how
many
people
go
here

couple
thousand
.
most
of
them

that
i
m
used
to

yeah
but
these
guys
have
never
seen
a
horse
.
they
just
jack
off
to
clint
eastwood

that
girl

you
burn
you
pine
you
perish

who
is
she

bianca
stratford
.
sophomore
.
don
t
even
think
about

why
not

i
could
start
with
your
haircut
but
it
doesn
t
matter
.
she
s
not
allowed
to
date
until
her
older
sister
does
.
and
that
s
an
impossibility

katarina
stratford
.
my
my
.
you
ve
been
terrorizing
ms.
blaise
again

expressing
my
opinion
is
not
a
terrorist
action

well
yes
compared
to
your
other
choices
of
expression
this
year
today
s
events
are
quite
mild
.
by
the
way
bobby
rictor
s
gonad
retrieval
operation
went
quite
well
in
case
you
re
interested

i
still
maintain
that
he
kicked
himself
in
the
balls
.
i
was
merely
a
spectator

the
point
is
kat
people
perceive
you
as
somewhat

tempestuous

no
...
i
believe
heinous
bitch
is
the
term
used
most
often

who
s
that

patrick
verona
random
skid

that
s
pat
verona
?
the
one
who
was
gone
for
a
year
?
i
heard
he
was
doing
porn
movies

i
m
sure
he
s
completely
incapable
of
doing
anything
that
interesting

he
always
look

block
e

mandella
eat
.
starving
yourself
is
a
very
slow
way
to
die

just
a
little

what
s
this

an
attempted
slit

i
realize
that
the
men
of
this
fine
institution
are
severely
lacking
but
killing
yourself
so
you
can
be
with
william
shakespeare
is
beyond
the
scope
of
normal
teenage
obsessions
.
you
re
venturing
far
past
daytime
talk
show
fodder
and
entering
the
world
of
those
who
need
very
expensive
therapy

but
imagine
the
things
he
d
say
during
sex

why
do
girls
like
that
always
like
guys
like
that

because
they
re
bred
to
.
their
mothers
liked
guys
like
that
and
their
grandmothers
before
them
.
their
gene
pool
is
rarely
diluted

he
always
have
that
shit
eating
grin

joey
dorsey
?
perma
shit
grin
.
i
wish
i
could
say
he
s
a
moron
but
he
s
number
twelve
in
the
class
.
and
a
model
.
mostly
regional
stuff
but
he
s
rumored
to
have
a
big
tube
sock
ad
coming
out

you
know
french

sure
do
...
my
mom
s
from

guess
who
just
signed
up
for
a
tutor

you
mean
i
d
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
her

you
could
consecrate
with
her
my
friend

the
vintage
look
is
over
kat
.
haven
t
you
been
reading
your
sassy

yeah
and
i
noticed
the
only
part
of
you
featured
in
your
big
kmart
spread
was
your
elbow
.
tough
break

they
re
running
the
rest
of
me
next
month

the
people
at
this
school
are
so
incredibly
foul

you
could
always
go
with
me
.
i
m
sure
william
has
some
friends

yeah
just
a
minor
encounter
with
the
shrew

that
s
her
?
bianca
s
sister

the
mewling
rampalian
wretch
herself

in
the
microwave

make
anyone
cry
today

where
ve
you
been

nowhere
...
hi
daddy

what
s
a
synonym
for
throbbing

sarah
lawrence
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
country

i
know

i
thought
we
decided
you
were
going
to
school
here
.
at
u
of

you
decided

now
don
t
get
upset
.
daddy
but
there
s
this
boy
...
and
i
think
he
might
ask

no
!
you
re
not
dating
until
your
sister
starts
dating
.
end
of
discussion

what
if
she
never
starts
dating

then
neither
will
you
.
and
i
ll
get
to
sleep
at
night

but
it
s
not
fair
she
s
a
mutant
daddy

this
from
someone
whose
diary
is
devoted
to
favorite
grooming
tips

enough

but
she
doesn
t
want
to
date

exactly
my

jesus
!
can
a
man
even
grab
a
sandwich
before
you
women
start
dilating

tumescent

you
re
not
helping

can
we
make
this
quick
?
roxanne
korrine
and
andrew
barrett
are
having
an
incredibly
horrendous
public
break
up
on
the
quad
.
again

well
i
thought
we
d
start
with
pronunciation
if
that
s
okay
with
you

not
the
hacking
and
gagging
and
spitting
part
.
please

okay
...
then
how
bout
we
try
out
some
french
cuisine
.
saturday
?
night

you
re
asking
me
out
.
that
s
so
cute
.
what
s
your
name
again

forget
it

no
no
it
s
my
fault
we
didn
t
have
a
proper

cameron

the
thing
is
cameron
i
m
at
the
mercy
of
a
particularly
hideous
breed
of
loser
.
my
sister
.
i
can
t
date
until
she
does

seems
like
she
could
get
a
date
easy
enough

why

unsolved
mystery
.
she
used
to
be
really
popular
when
she
started
high
school
then
it
was
just
like
she
got
sick
of
it
or
something

that
s
a
shame

gosh
if
only
we
could
find
kat
a
boyfriend

let
me
see
what
i
can
do

i
teach
her
french
get
to
know
her
dazzle
her
with
charm
and
she
falls
in
love
with
me

unlikely
but
even
so
she
still
can
t
go
out
with
you
.
so
what
s
the
point

what
about
him

you
wan
na
go
out
with
him

what
makes
you
think
he
ll
do
it

he
seems
like
he
thrives
on

no
kidding
.
he
s
a
criminal
.
i
heard
he
lit
a
state
trooper
on
fire
.
he
just
got
out
of
alcatraz

they
always
let
felons
sit
in
on
honors
biology

i
m
serious
man
he
s
whacked
.
he
sold
his
own
liver
on
the
black
market
so
he
could
buy
new
speakers

forget
his
reputation
.
do
you
think
we
ve
got
a
plan
or
not

did
she
actually
say
she
d
go
out
with
you

that
s
what
i
just

you
know
if
you
do
go
out
with
bianca
you
d
be
set
.
you
d
outrank
everyone
.
strictly
a
list
.
with
me
by
your
side

i
thought
you
hated
those
people

hey
i
ve
got
ta
have
a
few
clients
when
i
get
to
wall
street

hey

are
you
lost

nope
just
came
by
to

we
don
t
chat

well
actually
i
thought
i
d
run
an
idea
by
you
.
you
know
just
to
see
if
you
re
interested

we
re
not

but
she
can
t
go
out
with
you
because
her
sister
is
this
insane
head
case
and
no
one
will
go
out
with
her
.
right

does
this
conversation
have
a
purpose

so
what
you
need
to
do
is
recruit
a
guy
who
ll
go
out
with
her
.
someone
who
s
up
for
the
job

you
got
him
involved

like
we
had
a
choice
?
besides
when
you
let
the
enemy
think
he
s
orchestrating
the
battle
you
re
in
a
position
of
power
.
we
let
him
pretend
he
s
calling
the
shots
and
while
he
s
busy
setting
up
the
plan
you
have
time
to
woo
bianca

so
he
has
this
huge
raging
fit
about
sarah
lawrence
and
insists
that
i
go
to
his
male
dominated
puking
frat
boy
number
one
golf
team
school
.
i
have
no
say
at
all

william
would
never
have
gone
to
a
state
school

william
didn
t
even
go
to
high

that
s
never
been

neither
has
his
heterosexuality

i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
but
i
m
consuming
.
do
you
mind

does
it
matter

if
i
was
bianca
it
would
be
any
school
you
want
precious
.
don
t
forget
your
tiara

i
don
t
understand
patrick
.
you
haven
t
done
anything
asinine
this
week
.
are
you
not
feeling
well

touch
of
the
flu

i
m
at
a
loss
then
.
what
should

talk
about
?

year
of
absence

don
t
we
discuss
your
driving
need
to
be
a
hemorrhoid

what

to
discuss

you
weren
t
abused
you
aren
t
stupid
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
you
re
only
slightly
psychotic
so
why
is
it
that
you
re
such
a
fuck
up

well
you
know
there
s
the
prestige
of
the
job
title
...
and
the
benefits
package
is
pretty
good

c
esc
ma
tete
.
this
is
my

right
.
see
?
you
re
ready
for
the
quiz

i
don
t
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.

useful
things
.
like
where
the
good
stores

chat
.
i
have
never
in
my

a
nice
one

and

catch

how
much

i
can
t
take
a
girl
like
that
out

of
my
way

can
you
at
least
start
wearing
a
bra

you
hate
me
don
t
you

i
don
t
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion

then
say
you

spend
dollar
night
at
the
track
with
me

and
why
would
i

the
ponies

your
eyes

my
hand

thirty

are
you
following
me

i

d
say
hi


you
re
not
a
big
talker

my
fenders

a
verbal
frenzy

my
insurance

then
tell
them

had
a
seizure

is
this
about
sarah
lawrence
?
you
punishing
me

i
thought
you
were
punishing
me

why
can
t
we
agree
on
this

because
you
re
making
decisions
for
me

as
a
parent
that
s
my

so
what
i
want
doesn
t
matter

you
re
eighteen
.
you
don
t
know
what
you
want
.
you
won
t
know
until
you
re
forty
five
and
you
don
t
have
it

i
want
to
go
to
an
east
coast
school
!
i
want
you
to
trust
me
to
make
my
own
choices
.
i

when
i
shell
out
fifty
i
expect
results

i
m
on

watching
the
bitch
trash
my
car
doesn
t
count
as
a
date

i
got
her
under
control
.
she
just
acts
crazed
in
public
to
keep
up
the
image

i
just
upped
my

what

a
hundred
bucks
a
date

forget
it

forget
her
sister
then

you
got
something
on
your
mind

i
counted
on
you
to
help
my
cause
.
you
and
that
thug
are
obviously
failing
.
aren
t
we
ever
going
on
our
date

you
have
my
word
.
as
a

you
re
sweet

how
do
you
get
your
hair
to
look
like
that

eber
s
deep
conditioner
every
two
days
.
and
i
never
ever
use
a
blowdryer
without
the
diffuser
attachment

say

what

whatever
the
hell
it
is
you
re
standin
there
waitin

a
major
jones
for
bianca
stratford

what
is
it
with

i
think
i
speak
correctly
when
i
say
that
cameron
s
love
is
pure
.
purer
than
say
joey
dorsey
s

dorsey
can
plow
whoever
he
wants
.
i
m
just
in
this
for
the
cash

that
s
where
we
can
help
you
.
with
kat

so
dorsey
can
get
the
girl

patrick
pat
you
re
not
looking
at
the
big
picture
.
joey
s
just
a
pawn
.
we
set
this
whole
thing
up
so
cameron
can
get
the
girl

you
two
are
gon
na
help
me
tame
the
wild
beast

we
re
your
guys

and
he
means
that
strictly
in
a
non
prison
movie
type
of
way

yeah
we

this
is
it
.
a
golden
opportunity
.
patrick

ask
katarina

the
party

in
that
case
we
ll
need
to
make
it
a
school
wide
blow
out

him

she

not
a

lesbian
?
no
.
i
found
a
picture
of
jared
leto

one
of
her
drawers
so
i

the
kind
of
guy
she

the
same
dermatologist
.

all

relevant
party
conversation

he
oily
or
dry

combination
.

i
thought
he
d
be
different

more
of
a

don
t
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door
opening
and
coat
holding

sometimes
i
wonder
if
the
guys

to
want
to
go
out
with

the
ones
we
actually
want
to
go
out

i
d
give
up
my
private
line
to
go
out
with
a
guy
like

need
to
talk

one
minute
think
that
you

any
effect
whatsoever
on

thy
force

man

hear
you

!
sacrifice
yourself
on
the
altar
of
dignity
and
even

scenario
you

for
awhile

what
s
the
worst

you

the
girl

he

!
i
sprung

i
m
afraid
of
heights

c
mon
.
it

family

i
figured
it
had
to
be
something
ridiculous
to

call

so
how
d
you
get
chapin

so
what
s
your
excuse

acting
the
way
we

i
don
t
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
then
they
expect
it
all
the
time
and
they
get
disappointed
when
you
change

so
if
you
disappoint
them
from
the
start
you
re
covered

something
like

then
you
screwed

how

you
never
disappointed
me

you

.
.

state
trooper

fallacy

the

a
prisoner
in

i
m
a
possession

they

what
keeps
me
up
to
my
elbows
in
placenta
all
day

i
know
you
hate
having
to
sit
home
because
i
m
not
susie
high
school

like
you
care

i
do
care
.
but
i
m
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
not
someone
else
s

i
wish
i
had
that
luxury
.
i
m
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom

i
can
t
go

you
won
t

joey
never

th
.
for
a

why

he
was
like
a
total

but
you

now
i
do
.
back
then
was
a
different
story

as
in

he
said
everyone
was
doing
it
.
so
i
did
it

you
did
what

just
once
.
afterwards
i
told
him
i
didn
t
want
to
anymore
.
i
wasn
t
ready
.
he
got
pissed
.
then
he
broke
up
with
me


after
that
i
swore
i
d
never
do
anything
just
because
everyone
else
was
doing
it
.
and
i
haven
t
since
.
except
for

gastro
intestinal

own
mind
about
him

no

you
didn
t
!
if
you
really
thought
i
could
make
my
own
decisions
you
would
ve
let
me
go
out
with
him
instead
of
helping
daddy
hold
me
hostage

that
s

i
m
not
stupid
enough
to
repeat
your
mistakes

i
guess
i
thought
i
was
protecting
you

god
you
re
just
like
him
!
just
keep
me
locked
away
in
the
dark
so
i
can

experience
anything
for

not
all
experiences

good
bianca
.
you
can
